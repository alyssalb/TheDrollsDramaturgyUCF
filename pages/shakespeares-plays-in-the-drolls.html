    <h1>Shakespeare's Plays in The Drolls</h1>
      <h2><i>Hamlet</i></h2>
        <p><i>Hamlet</i> is one of Shakespeare's most famous and most performed plays, a tragedy about the Prince of Denmark whose father is killed by his uncle, who then marries his mother. Hamlet struggles with his unsurety and inability to take action for most of the play, and it often acts as an introspection on the complex behavior of humans in complicated situations.</p>
         <ul>
           <li>Pp. 19 "I have heard the cock, that is the trumpet of the morn..."; spoken by Horatio, coming out of the night when he saw King Hamlet's ghost and recognizing with relief the morning.</li>
           <li>Pp. 42 "To Be or Not to Be"; from probably the most famous Shakespearean soliloquy. Here, Hamlet debates his options - to kill himself and not have to agonize over his choices in a complicated and dire situation, or to live for fear of the unknown after death.</li>
           <li>Pp. 45 "But look, the morn in russet mantle clad..."; another Horatio line about welcoming the morning after a fearful night.</li>
           <li>Pp. 50 "There is nothing good nor bad but thinking makes it so"; Hamlet.</li>
           <li>Pp. 58 "Death, the undiscovered country from whose bourn no traveler returns"; Hamlet, the soliloquy.</li>
           <li>Pp. 59 Mocking Cowly with the to be or not to be speech.</li>
           <li>Pp. 60 "Speak to me no more!"; Queen Gertrude doesn't want to hear about her husband's villainy.</li>
           <li>Pp. 81 "Is thy noble mind overthrown"; a paraphrase of an Ophelia line.</li>
           <li>Pp. 81 "Pangs of despised love"; one of the hardships that Hamlet contemplates in his big soliloquy.</li>
         </ul>
      <h2><i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i></h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Pp. 81 "Angel awoke me from my flowery bed"; Titania, queen of the fairies, awoken by Bottom.</li>
          <li>Pp. 83 <a href="https://youtu.be/zPv9ICpMyRw?si=vz_xjPDomsjaEScS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Rude Mechanicals</a> perform Pyramus and Thisbe; the play performed by the amateur acting troupe at the end of Midsummer. </li>
        </ul>
      <h2><i>Richard II</i></h2>
        <p><i>Richard II</i> is one of Shakespeare's histories, centered on the actions and scenarios that led to the overthrow and murder of King Richard II of England.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pp. 58 "Let's talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs"; Richard II grapples with his mortality and the inevitability of his death in the upcoming fight for his throne.</li>
          <li>Pp. 71 "This royal throne of kings, this sceptred isle..."; a prophecy about Richard's downfall.</li>
        </ul>
      <h2><i>Romeo and Juliet</i></h2>
        <p>A tragedy about two teenagers in ill-fated love.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pp. 30 "Oh speak again bright angel"; from the Balcony scene, Juliet is angelic to Romeo and often portrayed to be physically over him in the balcony, literalizing this metaphor.</li>
          <li>Pp. 30 "It is  my lady, o, it is my love" and "she speaks, yet she says nothing" and so on; same scene, Romeo is overwhelmed with infatuation.</li>
          <li>Pp. 81 "Sinking under love's heavy burden"; paraphrase Romeo.</li>
          <li>Pp. 81 "He is as glorious to this night"; paraphrase Romeo.</li>
          <li>Pp. 83 "Is there not pity sitting in the clouds"; quote from Juliet.</li>
          <li>Pp. 83 "But soft, what light through yonder window breaks".</li>
        </ul>
      <h2>Sonnets</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Pp. 23 "She is more beautiful than a summer's day"; alludes to <i>Sonnet 18</i>, "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?", a poem in which the narrator immortalizes their lover by recording their beauty in a poem - so long as the poem lives, so too does the beauty of the person it captures.</li>        
          <li>Pp. 29 references this same sonnet.</li>
          <li>Pp. 82 references this same sonnet.</li>
        </ul>
      <h2><i>The Taming of the Shrew</i></h2>
        <p>This play centers around a "shrewish" or independent, witty, and outspoken woman, who is "tamed" by a man into marriage through manipulation.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pp. 29 "Do not offer war when you should kneel for peace"; this is from the final speech of Katherine (the "shrew) to Petruchio (the man who "tamed" her), and reflects her new perspective on how women should behave. Whether this is intended by Katherine as earnest or ironic can be debated, but either way it shows the manipulation she has undergone and the situation she finds herself in at the end of the play. Whether she believes it or not, it is how she has to behave.</li>
        </ul>
      <h2><i>The Tempest</i></h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Pp. 81 "The very instant that you saw him"; paraphrase.</li>
          <li>Pp. 83 "Hell is empty, and all the devils are here".</li>
          <li>Pp. 96 "Oh brave new world, that hath such people in it".</li>
        </ul>
      <h2><i>Macbeth</i></h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Pp. 60 "Oh horror, horror, horror"; spoken by Macduff upon finding Duncan's body.</li>
        </ul>
      <h2><i>As You Like It</i></h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Pp. 61 "I beseech you, punish me not".</li>
          <li>Pp. 96 "The lusty horn is not a thing to laugh or scorn".</li>
        </ul>
      <h2>Misc.</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Pp. 60 "I was tricked"; this line appears in several plays and various contexts, as a common phrase.</li>
          <li>Pp. 81 "Art thou wandering in an unknown field"; paraphrase, <i>The Comedy of Errors</i>.</li>
          <li>Pp. 82 "And yet he is not"; <i>Henry VI, Part I</i>.</li>
          <li>Pp. 83 "Oh let me not be mad"; <i>King Lear</i>.</li>
          <li>Pp. 99 "There is a fair behaviour in thee, captain"; <i>Twelfth Night</i>.</li>
