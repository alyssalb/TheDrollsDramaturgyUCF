    <h1>Introduction to Drolls</h1>
      <h2>Drollery Cliff Notes</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Often extracted from well-known farces, folk tales, and plays (Shakespeare, Beaumont and Fletcher).</li>
          <li>Emphasized physical comedy, quick pacing, and familiar character archetypes - easy to follow and packed with low brow humor.</li>
          <li>Reworked into 10-15 minute bits to be performed at inns and taverns or on the street.</li>
          <li>Music, dancing, clowning, and political satire were all common features of drolls.</li>
        </ul>
      <h2>Features and Key Figures</h2>
        <p><b>Definition:</b> Short, comic, often subversive theatrical sketches first performed in the Interregnum or Commonwealth period of England under Puritan rule.</p>
        <p><b>Function:</b> To circumvent censorship, maintain audience appetite for drama, use skills to earn potential wage in a time of extreme depression. Artists endeavor to make art, regardless of circumstance or cost.</p>
        <p><b>Origins:</b> Created during theatre closures from 1642-1660 in England, lining up with the start of the English Civil War. Often adaptations of familiar folk tales and farces, and usually played up to be extremely bawdy and crude in nature.
          <ul>
            <li>Some were adapted from more serious work, such as Shakespeare. In that case they generally adapted comedic bits, such as the clowns like Falstaff and the Rude Mechanicals.</li>
            <li>Not many people would have strongly remembered Shakespeare and his contemporaries on the stage, though they would be familiar with the arts as an important part of society. Shakespeare died circa 1616, and shortly after Puritan rule began most theaters were deconstructed (the Red Bull in Clerkenwell appears to have been maintained and ignored/repurposed).</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      <p>Robert Cox: Actor and comic droll adaptor; the most famous droll performer, and apparently the only one we have any information on at all.</p>
      <p>Francis Kirkman: Bookseller and publisher of <i>The Wits, or Sport Upon Sport</i> (1662). This is the most comprehensive and contemporary (to the form) compliation of Drolleries we still have, produced just after theaters reopened and the ban on creativity was lifted.</p>
