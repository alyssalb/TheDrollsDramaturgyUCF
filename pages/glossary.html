            Droll

          <div class="definition">From the <a href="https://johnsonsdictionaryonline.com/views/search.php?term=droll" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samuel Johnson Dictionary:</a> "One whose business is to raise mirth by petty tricks; a jester; a buffoon" and "a farce; something exhibited to raise mirth"; largely associated with the drolls of the Interregnum in England, acts of guerrilla and underground theatre and performance that kept entertainment alive in a time of extreme artistic suppression. The Drolls were extremely bawdy and crass acts put on spur of the moment by small troupes of actors with little to no set or costumes and very minimal props. Acts were short, often abridged or adapted from previous existing material, folk tales and pastorals, or improvised on the spot by actors.</div>

            Interregnum and Puritan England
          </div>
          <div class="definition">The period of Puritan rule under leader Oliver Cromwell after the beheading of King Charles I and before his son's ascendency to the throne. During and after the English Civil War. The Puritans banned most forms of merriment and entertainment, including theatre, gambling, Christmas and Easter celebrations, dancing and singing in public, rhyming in public, etc. They did allow things like the opera, likely due to Cromwell's personal tastes. The period of theatrical reopenings after this time moved us towards the modern model of smaller indoor theatres and single-purpose private theatrical venues, and away from a long history of outdoor, publicly accessible theatre.</div>

From the script, "Africans began living in England in the 1400s. Most came from the Barbary coast or countries in Western Africa. At the time of their arrival, Tudor England was a small, relatively weak kingdom which had not yet experienced the horrors of the transatlantic slave trade. The blackamoors inhabited every segment of English society, from the royal court to the bawdy houses."</div>

This was a real form of punishment, often against women who were too loud, outspoken, or employed in sex work (and caught by the law). A custom "cucking" or "ducking" stool allowed the body to be strapped on, and then swiveled over the water of the Thames and dunked multiple times. A powerful form of public shaming, potentially dangerous, and usually heavily attended by a crowd of jeering spectators (as most punishments and executions were at the time).</div>

John and Jane Davenant, parents of William, took ownership over the tavern around 1600 and earned a coveted wine license within the city. Shakespeare lived in or frequented the location, and is rumored to be the real father of William. Shakespeare's documents, left lying around the Tavern, contribute importantly to our contemporary knowledge of him - that is, that we know of him at all is often attributed to the papers kept by William Davenant from the Crown and used in the theatres during the Restoration.</div>

          <div class="definition">Drag was not uncommon in this time, both on the stages and on the streets (though often punished in the latter case). It was considered with suspicion, but allowed onstage prior to the Interregnum. Some evidence suggests that cross-dressing in regular life/on the streets may have been a more dominant behavior of women, for a variety of purposes mostly related to increased perception of personal freedom to navigate society. This came at a cost.</div>
