    <h1>Dramaturg's Note</h1>
      <p>Hello cast and crew of <i>The Drolls</i> at UCF Pegasus PlayLab 2025! This packet provides historical, contextual, and thematic grounding for our process. Drolls represent a vibrant and subversive form of theatre, proving our survival instinct and power as artists to persevere even under such conditions as the Puritan rule in 17th Century England, which shut down almost all artistic [re]production in the UK for a time.</p>
      <p>The hope is for these materials to help frame and deepen our understanding of the world that these characters, several based on real people, inhabited so that we might more richly present that world on stage. This context should aid us in bringing that humour, defiance, tenacity, and persistence characteristic of the time, place, and people in the play to life in our staged workshop production.</p>
      <p>This document is a starting place -- take what is useful and leave what is not. And above all, please contact me or catch me during/after rehearsal if you have questions or thoughts at any time during this process. I am happy to talk through things and do further research as we proceed through the production process. Contact me at any time at alyssa.barrack@ucf.edu.</p>
