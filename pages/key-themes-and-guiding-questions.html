    <h1>Key Themes and Guiding Questions</h1>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Resistance Through Humor:</b> How do drolls use comedy to critique authority></li>
        <li><b>Theatre as Survival:</b> What risks did performers take to keep performing? What risks might have existed if they hadn't kept performing?</li>
        <li><b>Adaptation and Compression:</b> How do these works differ structurally and in impact from full-length plays? What might this say about methods of adaptation to new formats?</li>
        <li><b>Audience and Space:</b> How did the absence of formal, purpose-built theaters shape performance style? How might audience have differed in this environment versus the sanctioned special-spaces of theaters before the closures?</li>
        <li><b>Reflection Prompts:</b> How would you adapt a scene from your favorite play or movie into a 5-10 minute street/found space sketch a-la Drolls? Have you every done geurrilla or found-space theater? Improv? What does that feel like as a performer versus structured plays and performances?</li>
